<h1>Dying MBP 17in (dead video cards)</h1><div><p>Yeah, my MBP 17in died two weeks ago, sent it in for repairs outside of warrenty and they repaired it for free - it&#x2019;s a known issue with a bad batch of NVIDIA chipsets - logic board replacement does the trick. Just make sure to create an admin acccount and give them the password so they don&#x2019;t wipe your machine ;)</p>
