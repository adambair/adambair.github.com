  <p>Safely commit to you repository with this simple rake task I whipped up.&#xA0; This will display the files to be committed, update your working copy to the latest code, migrate your database, run your specs, and commit if everything is all set.&#xA0; Another side effect is that you have a larger window in which to cancel your commits &#x2014; which can be a good thing.</p>
