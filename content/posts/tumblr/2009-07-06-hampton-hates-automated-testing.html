<h1>Hampton Hates Automated Testing</h1><div><p>&#x201C;Hampton, I may be a year late in saying so but&#x2026; yes, I find your rambling at the camera to be interesting! That sounds creepy, but it&#x2019;s not. I&#x2019;m just replying to the last 5 seconds of your video where you asked to let you know if you&#x2019;re video was interesting. Which it is. Was. Interesting. Now it&#x2019;s getting creepy. I apologize for descent into creepiness; that was a fine video my good man. Okay I just need to stop.&#x201D;</p>
