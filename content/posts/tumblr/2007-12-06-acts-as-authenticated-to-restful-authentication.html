<h1>Acts_as_authenticated to RESTful Authentication</h1><div>
  <p>I just finished converting an existing application with a bunch of custom methods from acts_as_authenticated to restful_authentication.  It took a good portion of the day &#x2014; but I managed to get it done without major complications and with full Rspec coverage.&#xA0; </p>
  <p>If you plan on doing this, it takes longer than you think - especially if you&#x2019;ve customized your authentication system.&#xA0;</p>
