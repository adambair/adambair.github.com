<h1>Trouble Starting Gitnub? (doesn't open)</h1><div><p>You can open console.app and check the logs &#x2014; in my case it said:</p>
<p><b> no such file to load &#x2014; open4 (LoadError)</b></p>
<p>Upon checking my installed gems &#x2014; open4 (0.9.6) was installed.&#xA0; Hrm.&#xA0; Checked around and apparently GitNub attempts to use the default OS X ruby install.&#xA0; Odd considering most rubyists I know usually gut the default Ruby install and just use MacPorts.&#xA0; Anyway &#x2014; Found that you can run the following to aleviate the issue:</p>
<p><b> `sudo /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/gem install open4`</b></p>
<p>Default OS X Ruby will now have the open4 gem and GitNub will be happy.</p></div>
