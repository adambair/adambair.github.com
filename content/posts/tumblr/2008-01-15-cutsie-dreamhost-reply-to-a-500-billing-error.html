<h1>Cutsie Dreamhost Reply to a $500 Billing Error</h1><div><p>I (and apparently thousands of other Dreamhost customers) were over charged by an entire year and were threatended with account suspension this morning.  This is the response that just arrived in my inbox: </p><blockquote>Hi Adam!<br/><br/>Ack. Through a COMPLETE bumbling on our part, we accidentally attempted to charge you for the ENTIRE year of 2008 (and probably 2009!) ALREADY it was all due to a fat finger)!<br/><br/>I&#x2019;m really really realllly embarassed about this, but you have nothing to worry about. You can just ignore any confusing billing messages you eceived recently; I already removed all those bum future charges on our account and fixed everything up.<br/><br/>Thank you very very much for your patience with this.. I PROMISE this won&#x2019;t happen again!<br/><br/>Please let me know if you have any other billing concerns or if I missed something or if you have any other questions at all!<br/><br/>Sorry again,<br/>Josh!<br/></blockquote>I guess I really expected a more professional response.</div>
