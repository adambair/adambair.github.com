<h1>This is the dream I had last night.</h1><div>
  <p>caribbean <br/>big storm<br/>low cloud ceiling, lightning, heavy rain<br/>standing on a beach<br/>small jet (like the kind you fly on from maine to dc)<br/>it&#x2019;s white with a red horizontal stripe that runs past the windows<br/>comes out of the clouds (&gt;1k ft) <br/>the tail is half ripped off and is flailing (where the engines are attached)<br/>the attached engine engine over powers, torques, and rips the rest of the tail section off<br/>the wing breaks off and it slams into the water right off the beach<br/>myself and another gentlemen franticly swim out to help people<br/>but they&#x2019;re all dead, from the impact or drowning<br/>the next day we&#x2019;re still pulling dead people out of the water<br/>along with the recuse people<br/>we&#x2019;re lining up the dead people on the beach<br/>some in body bags, some not<br/>after a while, I get exhausted and sit down on the beach<br/>dig my feet into the sand<br/>and I stare off into the distance above the ocean<br/>after sitting there for a while<br/>a small boy sits down next to me<br/>he isn&#x2019;t more than 4 years old<br/>and starts a conversation<br/>we talk about all kinds of things<br/>what he had for lunch<br/>his favorite toys<br/>how he loves his parents<br/>he has a dog that he plays with<br/>very happy and content <br/>it&#x2019;s very calming and welcome after what I&#x2019;ve been through<br/>I&#x2019;m telling him about my life<br/>my wife, my kids<br/>then I notice he&#x2019;s not talking any more<br/>just as rescue worker comes up to me<br/>and he asks who I&#x2019;m talking to<br/>I look over <br/>and there&#x2019;s the boy with his eyes closed<br/>laying on his back, half covered in sand<br/>dead.</p>
