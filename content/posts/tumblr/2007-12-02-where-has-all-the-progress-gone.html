<h1>Where has all the progress gone.</h1><div>
  <p>I stumbled upon an article regarding a few of the amazing things Nicola Tesla was able to accomplish 100 years ago. </p>
  <blockquote>&#x201C;Tesla spent his     remaining funds on his other inventions and culminated his     efforts in a major breakthrough in 1899 at Colorado Springs     by transmitting 100 million volts of high-frequency electric     power wirelessly over a distance of 26 miles at which he lit     up a bank of 200 light bulbs and ran one electric motor! <p>With     this souped up version of his Tesla coil, Tesla claimed that     only 5% of the transmitted energy was lost in the process.     But broke of funds again, he looked for investors to back his     project of broadcasting electric power in almost unlimited     amounts to any point on the globe. &#x201C;</p></blockquote>
