</p> <div>
  <p>I knew it would only be a matter of time before people would piggyback on Zed&#x2019;s critique on the Rails community; the attention he received pretty much guaranteed copycats.<br/><br/>Dreamhost - how about this: stop writing blog posts demanding solutions from the community (most of whom have no vested interest in shared hosting) and develop your own solutions.  If you find Rails so difficult to support and deploy, don&#x2019;t do it or fix it.  You can&#x2019;t expect the community to produce solutions for all of your specific issues.  <br/><br/>There are plenty of companies that host Rails applications without issue and there is no reason that you can&#x2019;t either.  That&#x2019;s the beauty of open source, if the solution doesn&#x2019;t exist, you have the distinct luxury of being able create it yourself without being at the mercy of an external vendor.<br/><br/>This is the exact attitude that pushes away the community from which you demand solutions.  <br/><br/>&#x201C;Don&#x2019;t treat the current Rails community as your unpaid vendor.&#x201D; -David<br/></p>
