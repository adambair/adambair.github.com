<h1>Talent is Overrated (Colvin) - meh</h1><div><p>Picked up this book at the PWM bookstore en route to BWI. Thought I was actually getting <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017922/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk">Outliers</a> (which is the one I actually wanted to read) &#x2014; but couldn&#x2019;t remember the title at the time. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842247/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1232333764&amp;sr=8-1">Talent is Overrated</a> is overrated, long winded, and lacks excitement:</p>
<p>Mozart and Tiger Woods practeded their entire lives? Their fathers were teachers? Practice from an early age makes people better at what they do?</p>
<p>Colvin could have just written that down in a page or two to save me the time reading 200-something pages hammering the same point home: practice makes you better.&#xA0; Seriously, we know this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R1ASFGWXZTXO73/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm">Robert&#x2019;s Amazon review</a> sums it up pretty nicely.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, Malcom Gladwell is the guy who gave the excellent <a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce.html">&#x2018;Spagetti&#x2019; talk on TED</a>.</p></div>
