<h1>New Altoids Packaging (inner wrapper)</h1><div>
  <div class="posterous_autopost"><p>As a long-time user and abuser of Altoids mints I was surprised when I opened a fresh tin to see that the classic white internal wrapper had changed&#x2026;</p>  <p>It seems that Callard and Bowser decided to add a few words to the usually blank thin inner white paper wrapper. I know, the death of a classic, fine, purists: take a moment to mourn the loss of the pristine, virginal white wrapper&#x2026; The cool part is when you finish all of the Altoids and reach the bottom of the tin. You are presented with nicely faded/misty text that fades through the other side of the wrapper. If you take out the wrapper you&#x2019;ll discover the text is printed in reverse on the backside of the paper. This is different than the text on the front/topside of the wrapper. C&amp;B took the time and resources to print on both sides of the wrapper in such a way to make the experience more pleasurable.</p>  <p>This, my friends, is why I buy Altoids. The experience. Tin, crinkly wrapper, strong simplistic mints, attention to detail. A modern classic.</p></div>
