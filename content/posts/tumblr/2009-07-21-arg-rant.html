<h1>Arg. Rant.</h1><div><p>#1</p>
<p>TDBanknorth changed their online banking site - the account register now looks like this (instead of a list of transactions, cleared and pending, on a single screen). <a href="http://skitch.com/adambair/b2xt2/seriously-tdbanknorth-online-banking">http://skitch.com/adambair/b2xt2/seriously-tdbanknorth-online-banking</a></p>
<p>I&#x2019;m a programmer/web developer guy and I can&#x2019;t suffer this kind of ignorance. I may actually have to switch banks. Yeah, I&#x2019;m probably crazy.</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>I needed to overnight some papers manually because our new benefit&#x2019;s provider forgot to include a pre-paid envelope with my paperwork&#x2026; Not a big deal. I set the papers down on the counter for a second while I grabbed the keys returning only to find that my daughter had attacked the pile with a pen and was drawing pictures of&#x2026; who knows. It was something.</p>
<p>Renae was nice enough to redo the few casualties &#x2014; so far, okay.</p>
<p>So I went to USPS. Filled out an envelope with the correct information only to be told that I can&#x2019;t overnight that package because it&#x2019;s not a USPS package and was given an envelope and a form to fill out. Filled it out but had to go to the back of the line. I waited in queue then presented the correct paperwork only to be told that they can&#x2019;t overnight anything today and that it will actually take 4 days. This was the same person I told that I needed to overnight a package only 20 mins ago. I said &#x201C;no thanks&#x201D;, turned to head out and was stopped by the same guy telling me that I needed to pay for the envelopes I had used. $2 an envelope. I filled out 2 because I fudged one as I don&#x2019;t write that often, I&#x2019;m a programmer damnit. Fine, I paid my $2 and got out.</p>
<p>Now it&#x2019;s raining (for real, in the real world, I&#x2019;m not emo).</p>
<p>Then I went to UPS. Found their single store in my area only to find out that the store is open 4PM to 6PM Monday-Thrusday. Yeah. Okay fine. WTF, but fine, whatever.</p>
<p>I found a FedExKinkos and walked in. Suddenly I had a dedicated associate assist me with the requisite paperwork and proper packing materials. And it was cheapter than all of the other options.</p>

<p>Fuck USPS. Fuck UPS. <br/>Fuck TDBanknorth and their online banking site.<br/>FedEx Ruls.</p></div>
