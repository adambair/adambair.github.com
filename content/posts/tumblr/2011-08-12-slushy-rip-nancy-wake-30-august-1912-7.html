<p>RIP NANCY WAKE&#xA0;(30 August 1912 &#x2013; 7 August 2011)</p>
<p>Ms Wake, who has died in London just before her 99th birthday, was a New Zealander brought up in Australia. She became a nurse, a journalist who interviewed Adolf Hitler, a wealthy French socialite, a British agent and a French resistance leader. She led 7,000 guerrilla fighters in battles against the Nazis in the northern Auvergne, just before the D-Day landings in 1944. <strong>On one occasion, she strangled an SS sentry with her bare hands</strong>. On another, she cycled 500 miles to replace lost codes. In June 1944, she led her fighters in an attack on the Gestapo headquarters at Montlucon in central France.</p>
<p>Work began earlier this month on a feature film about Nancy Wake&#x2019;s life. Ms Wake, one of the models for Sebastian Faulks&#x2019; fictional heroine, Charlotte Gray, had mixed feelings about previous cinematic efforts to portray her wartime exploits, including a TV mini-series made in 1987.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was well-acted but in parts it was extremely stupid,&#x201D; she said. &#x201C;At one stage they had me cooking eggs and bacon to feed the men. For goodness&#x2019; sake, did the Allies parachute me into France to fry eggs and bacon for the men? There wasn&#x2019;t an egg to be had for love nor money. <strong>Even if there had been why would I be frying it?</strong> I had men to do that sort of thing.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Ms Wake was also furious the TV series suggested she had had a love affair with one of her fellow fighters.<strong> She was too busy killing Nazis for amorous entanglements, she said.</strong></p>
<p>Even before she escaped to Britain, through Spain, in 1943 to train as a guerrilla leader, Nancy had been<strong> top of the Gestapo&#x2019;s French &#x201C;wanted&#x201D; list.</strong> With her husband, she ran a resistance network which helped to smuggle Jews and allied airmen out of the country.</p>
<p>Nancy recalled later in life that her parachute had snagged in a tree. The French resistance fighter who freed her said he wished all trees bore &#x201C;such beautiful fruit&#x201D;. Nancy retorted:<em> &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t give me that French shit.&#x201D;</em></p>
<p>&lt;3 what a bad ass &lt;3</p>
