<h1>Trouble with gnuscreen on osx?</h1><div><p>When I loaded up screen on OSX (10.5) it seemed like I was missing some things &#x2014; like having the git status on my prompt, among other things. Apparently screen doesn&#x2019;t read ~/.profile by default.</p>
<p>I found some inspiration here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/silassewell/wiki/ScreenOSX">http://code.google.com/p/silassewell/wiki/ScreenOSX</a> and used the setup below to resolve my issue:</p>
<p><b>~/.profile</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">export SHELL='/bin/bash -rcfile ~/.profile'</pre>
<p><b>~/.screenrc</b></p>
<pre class="prettyprint">shell -$SHELL</pre></div>
