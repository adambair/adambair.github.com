<div class="quote">&ldquo;If I had not gone into Monty Python, I probably would have stuck to my original plan to graduate and become a chartered accountant, perhaps a barrister lawyer, and gotten a nice house in the suburbs, with a nice wife and kids, and gotten a country club membership, and then I would have killed myself.&rdquo;</div><div>&mdash; John Marwood Cleese &#x2014; On <i>Fresh Air</i> with Terry Gross (1997)</div>
