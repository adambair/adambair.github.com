<h1>Duraflame Cleaner than Real Wood?</h1><div>
  <p>Just saw a Duraflame Log commercial on the tele &#x2014; it&#x2019;s claiming that burning a Duraflame Log is cleaner and better for the environment than burning real wood.&#xA0; That seems weird to me&#x2026; although a quick google seems to confirm their claim.&#xA0; Odd. </p>
